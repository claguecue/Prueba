- The work has been done locally and then has been uploaded to GitHub, so the follow-up does not appear.
   It was carried out locally because the test was being carried out and then there was no time to repeat it, 
   since it has taken more than 4 hours to do the project.

- I would like to have been able to carry out the project with a good labeling on GitHub for its correct monitoring,
  but it has not been possible due to the comments.

- I carried out the project based on a Starter Project that I had established from the university, 
  with a hsqldb database which is accessed through the link "localhost:80/h2-console".

- The system can be deployed in a cmd in the project folder with the command "mvn spring-boot:run".

- Once it is running, access the initial menu with the URL "localhost:80/accounts/all". 
  As a result of this, you can already do the other functionalities.
